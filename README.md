# Newton_Markdown_Demo
This is a small project to practice using GitHub. 

I'd like to use the project to demonstrate a cool trick for displaying data in R Markdown. But, I want to make sure that group members find the skill useful.

**Here are three options for a cool trick we can explore.**

1. How to conditionally format tables in a markdown report - e.g., like this:

2. How to make your data tables, graphs, maps etc interactive in a html markdown report using `crosstalk`, which is like a "Shiny-light" to create simple widgets
3. How to save and use LIO's topographic map backgrounds as a basemap for ggplot maps in R.
